# **2nd Workshop on Causal Inference and Machine Learning in Practice**

## **Schedule**

* Barcelona, Spain
* Date: TBD (Sunday 25 August 2024 â€“ Thursday 29 August 2024)
* Time: TBD

## **Abstract**

The increasing demand for data-driven decision-making has led to the rapid growth of machine learning applications in
various industries. However, the ability to draw causal inferences from observational data remains a crucial challenge.
In recent years, causal inference has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding the effects of interventions in
complex systems. Combining causal inference with machine learning has the potential to provide a deeper understanding of
the underlying mechanisms and to develop more effective solutions to real-world problems.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to share their experiences
and insights on applying causal inference and machine learning techniques to real-world problems in the areas of
product, brand, policy, and beyond. The workshop welcomes original research that covers machine learning theory, deep
learning, causal inference, and online learning. Additionally, the workshop encourages topics that address scalable
system design, algorithm bias, and interpretability.

Through keynote talks, panel discussions, and contributed talks and posters, the workshop will provide a forum for
discussing the latest advances and challenges in applying causal inference and machine learning to real-world problems.
The workshop will also offer opportunities for networking and collaboration among researchers and practitioners working
in industry, government, and academia.
