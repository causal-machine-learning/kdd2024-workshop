# **2nd Workshop on Causal Inference and Machine Learning in Practice**

## **Schedule**

* **Room 116**, Centre de Convencions Internacional de Barcelona (CCIB), Plaça de Willy Brandt, 11-14, Sant Martí, 08019, Barcelona, Spain ([Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D5TqrBXQPJKikWJJ9))
* Date: Monday, August 26
* Time: 9:00 AM – 1:00 PM (CEST)

## **Abstract**

The increasing demand for data-driven decision-making has led to the rapid growth of machine learning applications in
various industries. However, the ability to draw causal inferences from observational data remains a crucial challenge.
In recent years, causal inference has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding the effects of interventions in
complex systems. Combining causal inference with machine learning has the potential to provide a deeper understanding of
the underlying mechanisms and to develop more effective solutions to real-world problems.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to share their experiences
and insights on applying causal inference and machine learning techniques to real-world problems in the areas of
product, brand, policy, and beyond. The workshop welcomes original research that covers machine learning theory, deep
learning, causal inference, and online learning. Additionally, the workshop encourages topics that address scalable
system design, algorithm bias, and interpretability.

Through keynote talks, panel discussions, and contributed talks and posters, the workshop will provide a forum for
discussing the latest advances and challenges in applying causal inference and machine learning to real-world problems.
The workshop will also offer opportunities for networking and collaboration among researchers and practitioners working
in industry, government, and academia.

#### Title
Light Duty Vehicles Decarbonisation: A Causal Modeling Perspective

#### Abstract
One of the major problems that humanity faces in the decades to come is climate change. Transportation is a leading source of GHG emissions and light duty vehicles are associated with a large portion of those emissions. Accordingly, many of the efforts to achieve carbon neutrality are focused on decarbonizing the production and usage of light duty vehicles. Deciding on what changes to make, however, is not a trivial task, since there are multiple possible interventions and in many cases the effects of those interventions are not straightforward to predict. Furthermore, different solutions might fit different contexts. In this talk I will describe the development of a causality-focused decision support system which will allow decision makers to compare a wide range of “what-if” scenarios. Causal modeling provides a natural framework for comparing the effects of different hypothetical interventions, and combining it with other modeling methods, such as supply chain modeling and lifetime analysis, can help us reach better decisions on essential environmental questions.

#### Title
Conformal Prediction: a new way to understand and exploit uncertainty in counterfactual inference and recommendation

#### Abstract
Point estimate is often not enough for decision-making. With conformal prediction, predictive intervals can be inferred in a distribution-free fashion. In contrast to traditional methods that rely on strong assumptions on the data distribution.
For conformal counterfactual inference, existing methods that construct confidence intervals for counterfactuals either rely on strong ignorability, or access to un-identifiable bounds calibrating the difference between observational and interventional data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach to provide predictive intervals for counterfactual outcomes with marginal coverage guarantees, even under hidden confounding. With less restrictive assumptions, our approach uses a fraction of interventional data to account for the covariate shift from observational to interventional data. Theoretical results demonstrate the conditions under which our method is strictly advantageous to the naive method that only uses interventional data. Experiments across synthetic and real-world data verifies the superiority of our methods compared with state-of-the-art baselines.
In addition, we developed novel conformal prediction methods for recommendation systems: the first inference-time stochastic ranking method for fairness utility trade-off and a novel method for fine-tuning pre-trained sequential recommenders.
